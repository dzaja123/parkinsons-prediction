## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is fetched from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). 
It includes features related to Parkinson's telemonitoring and the corresponding target variables.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dzaja123/parkinsons-prediction.git
   cd parkinsons-prediction
   ```

2. Installation
Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

# Data Exploration
The data exploration phase involves the following key activities:

- Fetching the dataset
- Displaying correlation matrices
- Exploring the distribution of features

# Data Visualization
Various visualization functions are implemented to gain insights into the data. 
Visualization techniques include:

- Scatter plots
- Histograms
- Pairplots

# Custom Regression Model
A custom regression model is implemented using TensorFlow. 
The architecture of the model includes multiple dense layers with different activation functions.

# Random Forest Model
A Random Forest model is trained and evaluated to provide a benchmark for comparison with the custom regression model.

# Results
The evaluation results for both the custom regression model and the Random Forest model are presented, including key metrics such as:

- Explained variance
- Mean absolute error
- Mean squared error
- RÂ² score

# Usage
You can use the provided code to explore and predict Parkinson's Disease severity. 
Adjustments to the models or additional features can be made based on your specific requirements.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, propose enhancements, or submit pull requests.
